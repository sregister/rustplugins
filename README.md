rustplugins
===========


UPDATE: NOV 2014
All these plugins are probably broken as rust and oxide have gone through
many updates since when these were written. I haven't been working on
nor do I plan to continue this work in anyway. I will keep it available
incase someone find this useful.


I'll be posting things in here. 

To install oxide plugins place in the correct directory then restart the server or run '''oxide.reload''' from f1 console
